# GameDesigns

Have you ever wanted to create a game, but had no clue, what it should be about? Here you might find some inspiration. Feel free to use all ideas as you want to, or contribute your own ideas.

## Contributions
If you have a great idea for a game but lack the resources to create it, you might want to share your idea, so the other can create a game using it. If you want to do so, feel free to create a pull request.

You are not a game designer, but you want to contribute your ideas in a graphical way? Concept arts of games are welcome as well! Either for already listed game ideas or for new ones.

## Creating Games
You really like one of the ideas, and want to create resources for it, as well as sharing them for open use? Please create a own repository. Just give credit to this repository in your readme.
